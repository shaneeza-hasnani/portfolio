                  My passion for fraud detection began during my undergraduate studies in Fraud Examination and Financial Forensics. 
                  What started as academic curiosity quickly became a calling when I realized how machine learning could revolutionize 
                  the way we detect and prevent financial crimes.

                  Today, as a <strong>Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE)</strong> and data scientist, I combine domain expertise in 
                  fraud examination with cutting-edge machine learning techniques. My work spans across various industries - from 
                  protecting educational service payments to analyzing healthcare fraud for government investigations.
                </p>

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  What drives me is the tangible impact of my work: every model I build has the potential to save organizations 
                  thousands of dollars and protect honest people from becoming victims of fraud. I believe that the best fraud 
                  detection systems are not just technically sophisticated, but also practical and interpretable for the teams 
                  that use them.
                </p>

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  When I'm not analyzing data or building models, I'm staying current with the latest developments in AI and 
                  machine learning, contributing to the fraud examination community, and mentoring other students interested 
                  in this fascinating intersection of technology and financial crime prevention.
